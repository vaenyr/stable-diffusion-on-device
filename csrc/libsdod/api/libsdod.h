/* Run a diffusion process.

   context - a previously prepared context obtained by a call to setup

   guidance_scale - scaling factor for the classifier-free guidance: scale * noise(x, t, p) - (1 - scale) * noise(x, t, ""), SD1.5 default is 7.5
   image_out - output buffer that will hold a resulting RGB image, in [H, W, C] order, values in range 0-255

   This function can either handle memory allocation on its own or work with a user-provided buffer.
   If the user wants to leave allocation to the function, please call it as:

    unsigned char* buffer = nullptr;
    unsigned int buffer_len = 0;

    generate_image(..., &buffer, &buffer_len);

   In which case the function will write to both ``buffer`` and ``buffer_len``. Note that setting initial value of ``buffer`` to ``nullptr``
   is important! Otherwise the code will assume a user-provided buffer with length 0 is to be used, which will result in an error.
   Otherwise, if user wants to reuse an existing buffer, the call should be made as:

    unsigned char* buffer = <existing_buffer>;
    unsigned int buffer_len = <length of the existing buffer>;

    generate_image(..., &buffer, &buffer_len);

   If the existing buffer is too small, the function will return an appropriate error.
   If it is too large, the function will continue its work as normal, and will return back the amount of data actually written to the buffer
   using the same ``buffer_len`` variable (similar to the case when allocation is performed by the function). Therefore it is important
   to keep the length of the original buffer as a separate variable - otherwise this information might be lost.

   In either case (allocation handled by the user, or by the function), it is the user's responsibility to free the buffer when it is no longer needed.

   Returns 0 if successful, otherwise an error code is returned.

   In general, the information about each error is stored per-error and per-context. There are two exceptions, though,
   when it is only stored per-error:
      1. If an error occurred while setting up a context, the user should pass nullptr as ``context`` to obtain necessary information.
      2. If an error is related to calling a function with invalid context (indicated by certain error codes) then ``context`` is also ignored.

   The method can return nullptr if either ``errorcode`` is not a valid error code, if ``context`` is not a valid context,
   if ``errorcode`` has not happened for ``context`` or if no extra information has been provided by the implementation when an error was recorded.
   Otherwise a null-terminated string is returned.
